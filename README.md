Requires Python 3.4, numpy matplotlib. It is recommended to use a python engineering package such as Anaconda 3.4.

Outputs graphs and average wave height (or time dependant parameter) from a text file.

Text file to be set up with time in column 1 and wave parameter in column 2.

1. Place program in same directory as file
2. Run program using python
3. Input textfile name
4. If there is a wave initialisation period at start of file this can be input and will be ignored by program.
